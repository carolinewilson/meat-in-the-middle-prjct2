# Project Feedback & Evaluvation

## Challenges
#### a) Project Management
* Limiting the scope of the project to ensure we could deliver a working and polished application within the timeframe.
* Getting used to multiple people working on the same code base using Git.

#### b) Technical
* Creating multiple states for the page.
* Connecting user actions on the results to the map markers.

## Future Opportunities
* Enable users to share directions with friends via social sharing options.
* Allow users to move the central point marker, should they so wish, to deliver nearby results for a location of their choosing. 
* Re-write using a framework such as AngularJS to better handle transition of states.
